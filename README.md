Simulating Bird Flock Behavior in Python Using Boids

Craig Reynolds, introduced a system known as “boids” that could simulate something similar to birds’ flocking behavior. His model of artificial life followed three simple rules:

separation: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates
alignment: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
cohesion: steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates
With only the above rules you can see emergent complexity arise out of almost nothing.
